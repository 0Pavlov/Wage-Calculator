# Description:

***This is a simple Wage Calculator made using the Kivy framework, allowing you to keep track of your earnings.***
I work at a company where earnings calculations can be complex. Even a simple change in hours worked may require a tedious, though not necessarily difficult, calculation process. To address this problem and make life easier, I decided to create this software.

## Features:

  - **Hourly Rate:** Adjustable hourly rate via slider (in increments of 5).
  - **Shifts:** Ability to calculate your earnings based on the number of shifts worked.
  - **Night:** Night hourly rate is automatically calculated (20% increase over the day rate).
  - **Additional Hours:** Ability to add or subtract additional day or night hours for precise tracking (e.g., if you were late or worked overtime).
  - **Precise Calculation:** All inputs are converted to hours and only then amount you've earned is calculated, ensuring accuracy.
  - **Bonuses:** Easily factor in speed and quality bonuses with a single button toggle.
  - **Themes:** Ability to change themes by pressing on the salary label (selected theme automatically saves and loads on the next app launch).

## Project Goals:

  - Enhance my Python programming skills.
  - Gain more practical experience with the Kivy framework for mobile app development.
  - Create a valuable tool for colleagues facing similar wage calculation challenges.

## Achievements:

  - **Solid Foundation:** Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns using Kivy's Widget classes for app elements.
  - **Minimalistic but Eye-Pleasing UI:** A general dark theme with a fitting accent color. Responsive buttons, a smooth slider, and an intuitive design.
  - **Clean and Readable Code:** Consistent indentation, meaningful variable names, and docstrings (where applicable) enhance code readability and maintainability.
  - **Universal Compatibility:** Designed to run smoothly on any Android device and supports different screen orientations.

## Key Learnings:

  - Practical application of Python and Kivy for mobile app development.
  - Principles of UI/UX design for intuitive user experiences.
